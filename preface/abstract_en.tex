Sample Text. The main difference between tabularx and tabular in LaTeX is that tabularx can be set to a pre-specified width, while tabular cannot. This means that tabularx is more flexible, as it can be used to create tables that fit perfectly within a given space.

However, tabular is often faster to typeset, as it does not require the same amount of calculations.
